# Spark analysis of Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This project provides a base AbstractApp class which manages Spark context and data loading into DataFrames.

By extending the AbstractApp and overrding the execute method, you have access to training and tests data inside DataFrames, sc:SparkContext and sqlContext:SQLContext.

Have fun !
